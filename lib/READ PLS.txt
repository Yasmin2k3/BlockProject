These are the JFreeChart external libraries that are required to use it for data visualisation.

So far, the best way I can think of is to put it this separate folder, so I'll give instructions on how I added it to IntelliJ.

I will probably look in to a better way of using external libraries for our submission, if someone has a better way of doing this, please fix this <3

How to install this on Intellij:

1. Download this repository

2. Press crtl + alt + shift + s
OR
Hover over the File tab (top left) and click Project Structure

3. In project Settings, click the 'Modules' tab and then 'Dependencies'

4. Click the + button below 'Module SDK: ___' and then click 'JARs or Directories...'

5. Navigate to .../BlockProject/lib/ in this repository's directory and click on one of the .jar files.

6. Repeat for the second .jar file

It should work now
